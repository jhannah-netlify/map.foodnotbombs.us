This is a DRAFT UNOFFICIAL map of Food Not Bombs groups.

[OFFICIAL MAP](http://foodnotbombs.net) (hundreds of groups, but out of date)

See this map rendered here: https://map.foodnotbombs.us

To add your group:
* Open a pull request against our `groups.js` file.
* If you don't know what a pull request is, that's fine, [create a github Issue](https://github.com/jhannah-netlify/map.foodnotbombs.us/issues) with all your group information and we'll add it for you.
* If you don't have or want a github account that's fine, just email your group info to jay@jays.net and he'll add it for you.

We used this demo as our starting point: https://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/
